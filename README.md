## Questions
1) //?? comments mark a question for a code reviewer.
2) How do I approach styling?
    - Vadim has suggested that I don't use MUI and make all my own components so I have the control I'm looking for. That sounds a bit much.
    - At the same time, my character fields are so many dom elements deep that styling them is difficult

## Todo
1) Style the form
2) Implement Autocomplete from options
3) Implement Advanced Category/SubCategory system
4) Complete dataset
5) Implement affinities
6) Allow fields not to contribute to affinities
6) Let user add options and adjust weightings
7) Implement the generate button for a single field
